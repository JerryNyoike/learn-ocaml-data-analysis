what do we want to do with the assignment?

1. the problem is that we don't really have multiple files in LearnOcaml,
as a result, we need to include the parser and the lexer in one single big file.
I guess it makes sense to ask students to provide a number of tests of parsing.

2. how do we grade students? do we have automated grade?

3. how do we want to have type variables and unification?

4. do we want to do bidirectional type checking, or just synthesis?

5. we should double check and confirm the syntax.

6. more operators?


7. students should write their own free variables. (Q 0.5)
8. dead code elimination (Q 1.5)
9. constant inlining
