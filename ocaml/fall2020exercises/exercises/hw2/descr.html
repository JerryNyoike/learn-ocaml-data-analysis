  <h2> Introduction </h2>
  <p>
    Congratulations! You made it to Week 2 of this course! Now that you know how to use OCaml, let's have a bit of fun using lists and user-defined datatypes.
  </p>
  <p>
    Once again, for each question, you are required to write <strong>both a set of tests and the function code itself</strong>. Particularly, for any function <code>f</code> you are asked to implement, you must write a good list of tests in the variable <code>f_tests</code>. Each test is a pair of the form <code>(input, output)</code>. You can read last week's introduction if you are still unsure of why to do them or how. You can also check it out for a reminder of the Learn-OCaml tools at your disposal.
  </p>
  <p>
    Note that any sample tests we provide will <em>not</em> be good enough to get you full marks should you decide to use them as your test cases.

  <h2>Working with lists: DNA</h2>

  <p>
    DNA is the building block of
  life. It is formed by finite sequences of nucleotides:
  </p>

  <p>
    <li> <strong>C</strong>ytosine </li>
    <li> <strong>G</strong>uanine</li>
    <li> <strong>A</strong>denine</li>
    <li> <strong>T</strong>hymine</li>
  </p>  

  <p> The sequences can get very long, and contain lots of redundant information.
  </p>
  <p>
  In this question we will develop a data compressor to save some
  space in very repetitive sequences.
  So if we have a sequence like: </p>
  </p>
  <pre>
AAAAGGATTTCTC
  </pre>
  <p>
  The compression function will replace repeating nucleotides by a
  pair of the number of times it appears and that particular
  nucleotide. Such as the previous sequence results in:
  </p>
   <pre>
[(4,A); (2, G); (1, A); (3, T); (1, C); (1, T); (1, C)]
  </pre>
  <p>
    We represent nucleotides as a data type <code>nucleobase</code> (see <code>prelude</code>).
  </p>
  <p>
  Write two functions to compress and decompress these DNA sequences
  such as decompressing a compressed sequence produces the original
  sequence. 
  </p>
  <p>
    <li><code>compress: nucleobase list -> (int * nucleobase) list</code></li>
    <li><code>decompress: (int * nucleobase) list -> nucleobase list</code></li>
  </p>

  <h2>User-defined datatypes: Pocket Calculator</h2>

  <p>
We consider here a simple pocket calculator for arithmetic expressions
constructed from floating point numbers (<code>FLOAT</code>), addition
(<code>PLUS</code>), subtraction (<code>MINUS</code>),multiplication
(<code>MULT</code>), in addition to sinus (<code>SIN</code>, cosinus
(<code>COS</code>), and exponential (<code>EXP</code>). We represent the
arithmetic expressions using a recursive data type in OCaml as follows: 

<pre>
type exp = 
  | PLUS  of exp * exp 
  | MINUS of exp * exp
  | MULT  of exp * exp 
  | DIV   of exp * exp
  | SIN   of exp     
  | COS   of exp     
  | EXP   of exp 
  | FLOAT of float  
</pre>
  </p>

  <p>
We can then for example represent the arithmetic expression <i>(2.2 + 3.3) * 5.0</i>
directly as <code>MULT (PLUS (FLOAT 2.2, FLOAT 3.3), FLOAT 5.0)</code>.
This representation directly encodes the syntactic structure, i.e. the
abstract syntax tree, of the arithmetic expression. This becomes
particularly obvious when we write the expression as a tree where
nodes correspond to a particular arithmetic operation.    
  </p>
<!-- LATEX REPRESENTATION OF THE AST -->  
<!-- \begin{minipage}[b]{4cm} -->
<!-- \Tree[.* [.+  2.2 3.3 ] -->
<!--           5.0 ]   -->
<!-- \end{minipage} -->
<!-- is represented as  -->
<!-- \begin{minipage}[b]{4cm} -->
<!-- \Tree[.\lstinline!MULT! [.\lstinline!PLUS! [.\lstinline!FLOAT! 2.2 ] -->
<!--                [.\lstinline!FLOAT! 3.3 ]] -->
<!--           [.\lstinline!FLOAT! 5.0 ]]   -->
<!-- \end{minipage}   -->


  <ul>
    <li> Implement the function  <code>eval: exp -> float</code> which takes an arithmetic expression of
  type <code>exp</code> as input and returns its corresponding floating
      point value.
 <pre>
# eval (MULT (PLUS (FLOAT 2.2, FLOAT 3.3), FLOAT 5.0));;
- : float = 27.5	
</pre>
    </li>
  </ul>

<p>Note: sin, cos, and exp are built-in functions. Angles should be specified in radians.</p>

<p>  
    Next, we consider translating an expression into a series of
instructions for an abstract machine of a simple pocket
calculator. The calculator uses instructions for addition
(<code>Plus</code>), subtraction (<code>Minus</code>), multiplication
(<code>Mult</code>), and division (<code>Div</code>). In addition, it
has instructions for computing the sinus (<code>Sin</code>), cosinus
(<code>Cos</code>), and exponential (<code>Exp</code>). 

The <i>instruction set</i> of the calculator is modelled using the
      following datatype in OCaml.
      <pre>
type instruction = 
  Plus | Minus | Mult | Div | Sin | Cos | Exp | Float of float	
      </pre>

The arithmetic expression <i>(2.2 + 3.3) * 5.0</i> can be also viewed as a list of
      instructions:
      <pre>
[Float 2.2; Float 3.3; Plus; Float 5.0; Mult]	
</pre>

    <ul>  
      <li>Implement a function= <code>to_instr:exp -> instruction list</code>
 that takes as input an arithmetic expression and returns a list of instructions.

	<p>
<i>Hint:</i> An expression of type <code>exp</code> describes the
abstract syntax tree of an arithmetic expression. Translating such an
expression to a list of instructions amounts to traversing the tree
and flattening it.

<pre>
# to_instr  (MULT (PLUS (FLOAT 2.2, FLOAT 3.3), FLOAT 5.0));;
- : instruction list = [Float 2.2; Float 3.3; Plus; Float 5.; Mult]
</pre>
</p>
      </li>
  </ul>
</p>      

<p>
We now want to implement a calculator by executing a list of
instructions. The calculator is viewed as a <i>stack machine</i> where a <i>stack</i> is a
list of floating point numbers and it is processed according to the
instruction set.

<pre>
type stack = float list
</pre>
</p>
<p>
Intuitively, we store intermediate values on the stack. The
instructions tell us what to do with these values.
</p>
<p> In the beginning the stack is empty. When we encounter a floating point number we simply push it
onto a stack. This stack is different from the instr stack (in particular the order of how arguments are stored is reversed. See detailed examples below:</p>
  <ol type="I">
    <li> When we encounter the instruction <code>Plus</code> we
      simply add the top two elements of the stack <code>[a;b;c ...]</code>
      returning a new stack <code>[b + a; c ...]</code> where we
      replace the top two elements with a single element describing their
      sum. Similarly we proceed when we encounter other instructions such as
      <code>Minus</code>, <code>Mult</code>, <code>Div</code> which all work
      on the top two elements of the stack.
    </li>
    <li> When we encounter one of the instructions <code>Sin</code>,
        <code>Cos</code>, <code>Exp</code> we apply the corresponding function
        to the top element of the stack, i.e. for example given the
        instruction <code>Sin</code> and the stack <code>[a; b; c ...]</code>
        we return <code>[sin a; b; c ...]</code>.
    </li>
  </ol>

<ul>
<li>
 Implement a function
  <code>instr:instruction -> stack -> stack option</code> which takes
  an instruction i and a stack s and returns a new stack according to the
  description above.
<p> The size of the stack s should be greater or equals to the number of arguments the instruction 
i expects, i.e. for a Plus instruction, the stack should have at least two elements (i.e.  instr Plus [1.; 1.]). 
Return None if this invariant is violated. </p>


<pre>
# instr Mult [5.0; 5.5];;
- : float list option = Some [27.5]
# instr Plus [2.2; 3.3; 5.0];;
- : float list option = Some [5.5; 5.]
# instr (Float 4.2) [2.2; 3.3; 5.5];;
- : float list option = Some [4.2; 2.2; 3.3; 5.5] 
</pre>
</li>


<li> Implement a function
  <code>prog:instruction list -> float option</code> which takes a list of
  instructions and computes the resulting floating point value. 
  If the list of instruction is not well-formed, return None as a final result.

   <i>Hint:</i> Implement a helper function that takes a list of
   instructions and a stack and returns the final floating point
   value.

<pre>
# prog [Float 2.2; Float 3.3; Plus; Float 5.; Mult];;
- : float option = Some 27.5 
</pre>
</li>
</ul
